## Project Benson 
### Problem to be Solved:
Our metaphorical Data Science Company was approached by a group called Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY). Their group is relativey new in New York, and will be hosting their annual gala event during the summer. They are interested in using street teams to hand out fliers in popular NYC subway stations.

Our task is to recommend a plan for their street team that will yield the highest attendence and largest donations during the Summer Gala. 

### Decoding the Problem and Planning Our Approach
My partner and I unpacked WTWY's request and determined that we were looking for locations that optimize 3 distinct factors:
* very busy subway stations
* wealthy populations
* regions with an interest in tech

We determined that our ideal audience consisted of wealthy, tech-focused individuals, who use high-traffic subway stations.

To utilize those distinct factors, we approached the data from 3 different angles:

1. Obtain MTA turnstile data:

* Obtain busiest subway stations

2. Obtain US census data to obtain income values:
* Clean census data and obtain boroughs/sub-boroughs that have high average incomes

3. Obtain location data for Startups in NYC:
* Correlate location of NYC startups with busiest subway stations and wealthiest sub-borough
